---

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### STEP 1: Database Migration (5 minutes)

**Go to:** [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/)

**Select:** Your project `srijani-orderPortal`

**Navigate to:** SQL Editor

**Run this SQL:**

```sql
-- Add video fields to orders table
ALTER TABLE orders 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS package_video_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS package_video_type VARCHAR(10) CHECK (package_video_type IN ('file', 'link')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS video_uploaded_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Add video fields to returns table
ALTER TABLE returns
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS video_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS video_type VARCHAR(10) CHECK (video_type IN ('file', 'link')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS video_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS video_waived_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS video_waived_at TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS video_waiver_reason TEXT;

-- Add return reason fields to return_items table
ALTER TABLE return_items
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS return_reason VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS return_description TEXT;

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_video_url ON orders(package_video_url) WHERE package_video_url IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_returns_video_url ON returns(video_url) WHERE video_url IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_returns_video_waived ON returns(video_waived_by) WHERE video_waived_by IS NOT NULL;
```

**Verify:** Run this to confirm columns were added:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'orders' AND column_name LIKE '%video%';
```

---

### STEP 2: Environment Variables (2 minutes)

**Go to:** [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)

**Select:** Your backend service `srijani-order-portal-backend`

**Navigate to:** Environment tab

**Add these 3 variables:**

```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dwfkw4h3m
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=627712439596983
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=CbX5ncZDQ8fOOe4QDMWypgQrnXs
```

**Click:** Save Changes

**Note:** Render will automatically restart your service.

---

### STEP 3: Deploy Code (1 minute)

```bash
# From your project root
git add .
git commit -m "Add video upload and return system"
git push origin main
```

**What happens:**
1. Code pushes to GitHub
2. Render automatically deploys backend (installs `cloudinary` package)
3. Vercel automatically deploys frontend
4. Both services restart with new code

**Wait:** 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

---

### STEP 4: Verify Deployment (2 minutes)

**Check Backend:**
```
https://srijani-order-portal-backend.onrender.com/api/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"ok",...}`

**Check Frontend:**
```
https://srijani-order-portal.vercel.app/login
```
Should load without errors

**Check Render Logs:**
- Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Logs
- Look for: "Server running on port 5001"
- No errors about Cloudinary

**Check Vercel Logs:**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
- Latest deployment should show "Ready"

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Cloudinary is not defined"
**Cause:** Environment variables not set or service not restarted
**Fix:**
1. Verify variables in Render dashboard
2. Manually restart service in Render
3. Check logs for startup errors

---

### Issue: Video upload fails with 400 error
**Cause:** Invalid file type or size
**Fix:**
1. Check file type: Only MP4, MOV, AVI, WEBM allowed
2. Check file size: Max 100 MB
3. Check browser console for detailed error

---

### Issue: Cannot create return - "Video required"
**Cause:** No video uploaded for order
**Fix:**
1. Go to order detail page
2. Upload package opening video
3. Wait for success message
4. Try creating return again

---

### Issue: Frontend shows old code
**Cause:** Browser cache or deployment not complete
**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Check Vercel deployment status
3. Clear browser cache completely

---

### Issue: Database migration fails
**Cause:** Columns might already exist or syntax error
**Fix:**
1. Check if columns exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'orders' AND column_name = 'package_video_url';
   ```
2. If exists, skip that ALTER statement
3. Run remaining statements individually
