# Complete Order Creation and Approval System

## Overview

The Srijani Order Management Portal now includes a comprehensive end-to-end order creation and approval system that automatically creates customer accounts and manages the entire order lifecycle.

## System Architecture

### 1. Admin Order Creation Flow

#### Backend Implementation (`backend/src/controllers/orderController.js`)

**Enhanced `createOrder` Function:**
- **Dual Customer Support**: Supports both existing customers (via `customer_id`) and new customers (via `customer_email` + `customer_name`)
- **Automatic Account Creation**: For new customers, automatically creates User and Customer records
- **Password Generation**: Generates secure passwords using pattern: `{first3letters}{last4digitsoftimestamp}`
- **Transaction Safety**: All operations wrapped in database transactions for data integrity
- **Activity Logging**: Logs all customer creation and order activities

**Key Features:**
```javascript
// New customer creation with automatic password generation
const namePrefix = customer_name.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z]/g, '').substring(0, 3);
const timestampSuffix = Date.now().toString().slice(-4);
const generatedPassword = `${namePrefix}${timestampSuffix}`;
```

#### Frontend Implementation (`frontend/src/views/admin/CreateOrder.vue`)

**Comprehensive Order Creation Interface:**
- **Customer Type Selection**: Radio buttons to choose between existing or new customer
- **Dynamic Form Fields**: Shows appropriate fields based on customer type selection
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validation with visual feedback
- **Item Management**: Add/remove order items with detailed product information
- **Total Calculation**: Automatic subtotal and total calculation
- **Order Details**: Payment method, currency, delivery date, and notes

**Key Features:**
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Form validation with computed properties
- Dynamic item addition/removal
- Real-time total calculation
- Customer selection dropdown for existing customers

### 2. Email Notification System

#### Enhanced Email Templates (`backend/src/services/emailService.js`)

**New Function: `sendOrderApprovalEmailWithCredentials`**
- **Welcome Message**: Personalized welcome for new customers
- **Login Credentials**: Prominently displays email and generated password
- **Order Details**: Complete order summary with items and pricing
- **Terms & Conditions**: Links to legal documents
- **Step-by-step Instructions**: Clear next steps for order approval
- **Professional Styling**: HTML email with proper formatting

**Email Content Structure:**
```html
- Welcome message with account creation notification
- Login credentials in highlighted box
- Complete order details table
- Terms & conditions acceptance requirement
- Action buttons for approval/rejection
- Step-by-step instructions
```

### 3. Customer Order Approval Flow

#### Enhanced Approval Interface (`frontend/src/views/customer/ApproveOrder.vue`)

**Comprehensive Order Review:**
- **Order Summary**: Detailed view of all order items with pricing
- **Order Details**: Status, dates, payment method, delivery estimates
- **Terms & Conditions**: Prominent display with links to legal documents
- **Approval Options**: Approve, Reject, or Request Changes
- **Terms Acceptance**: Required checkbox for order approval
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all required fields are completed

**Key Features:**
- Real-time form validation
- Terms acceptance requirement for approval
- Detailed order information display
- Professional UI with clear action buttons
- Error handling and user feedback

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Updated Routes (`backend/src/routes/order.routes.js`)

**Enhanced Validation:**
```javascript
// Supports both existing and new customer creation
body('customer_id').optional().isUUID()
body('customer_email').optional().isEmail()
body('customer_name').optional().notEmpty()
// Custom validation ensures either customer_id OR customer_email+name
```

#### Order Controller Methods

**`createOrder`**: Enhanced to support automatic customer creation
**`approveOrder`**: Existing method for customer order approval
**`updateOrderStatus`**: Admin method for status updates

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Admin Creates Order
1. Admin accesses `/admin/orders/create`
2. Selects "New Customer" option
3. Enters customer details (name, email, phone)
4. Adds order items with quantities and prices
5. Sets order details (payment method, delivery date, etc.)
6. Submits order creation

### Step 2: System Processing
1. **Customer Account Creation**:
   - Generates unique password
   - Creates User record with hashed password
   - Creates Customer profile
   - Logs activity for audit trail

2. **Order Creation**:
   - Creates Order record with `pending_approval` status
   - Creates OrderItem records for each product
   - Creates OrderStatusHistory entry
   - Logs order creation activity

3. **Email Notification**:
   - Sends welcome email with login credentials
   - Includes complete order details
   - Provides approval links and instructions

### Step 3: Customer Receives Email
1. Customer receives email with:
   - Welcome message
   - Login credentials (email + generated password)
   - Complete order details
   - Links to approve/reject order
   - Terms & conditions links

### Step 4: Customer Approval Process
1. Customer clicks "Approve Order" in email
2. Redirected to `/orders/{id}/approve`
3. Reviews complete order details
4. Reads terms & conditions
5. Selects approval decision
6. Accepts terms (if approving)
7. Submits decision

### Step 5: System Updates
1. **If Approved**:
   - Order status changes to `confirmed`
   - Consent logged with IP and timestamp
   - Confirmation email sent
   - Order proceeds to fulfillment

2. **If Rejected/Changes Requested**:
   - Admin notification sent
   - Order status updated accordingly
   - Customer notified of decision

## Security Features

### Password Generation
- **Pattern**: First 3 letters of name + last 4 digits of timestamp
- **Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- **Uniqueness**: Timestamp ensures uniqueness even for same names

### Data Protection
- **Transaction Safety**: All database operations wrapped in transactions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all inputs
- **Activity Logging**: All actions logged with IP addresses
- **Consent Tracking**: GDPR-compliant consent logging

### Access Control
- **Role-based Access**: Admin-only order creation, customer-only approval
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Status Validation**: Orders can only be approved if in `pending_approval` status

## Database Schema Updates

### User Model
- Standard fields: email, password, name, phone, role
- Password hashing via bcrypt hooks
- Email verification and activity tracking

### Customer Model
